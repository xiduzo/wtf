name: wtf.loop
description: This skill should be used when a developer wants to autonomously execute all tasks under a fully-specified Epic or Feature — for example "go", "start building", "implement everything", "run the loop", "execute the feature", "build it all", "kick it off". Requires that the Epic/Feature/Task tree is fully written before starting. Chains implement → verify → PR for every task in dependency order, with targeted human-in-the-loop gates for contradictions and ambiguities.

# Loop

Autonomously execute a fully-specified Epic or Feature. Core value: once the spec tree is complete (Epic → Features → Tasks), the developer says "go" and the system chains `wtf.implement-task → wtf.verify-task → wtf.create-pr` for every Task in dependency order — surfacing only the decisions a human must actually make.

Shared behavior used throughout this skill:

- Sub-agent spawning rules → `../references/subagent-protocol.md`
- File-conflict graph coloring → `../references/conflict-graph.md`
- Commit and PR conventions → `../references/commit-conventions.md`
- Branch and worktree setup → `../references/branch-setup.md`
- Pre-flight checks (step 2) → `references/pre-flight-validation.md`
- Per-task execution (step 4) → `references/task-execution.md`

## Pre-conditions

Before starting, all of the following must be true:

- All Tasks under the target Feature(s) have been written (`wtf.write-task` complete)
- All Tasks have been designed (`wtf.design-task` complete, `designed` label present) — or the user explicitly waives this
- No Task is missing Gherkin scenarios or Contracts

If any pre-condition fails, surface it as a gate (step 2) rather than stopping silently.

## Process

### 0. GitHub CLI setup

Run steps 1–2 of `../references/gh-setup.md` (install + auth). Stop if `gh` is not installed or not authenticated.

Verify that the following extensions are available — they are required for dependency ordering and hierarchy traversal:

```bash
gh extension list
```

Required:

- `yahsan2/gh-sub-issue` — hierarchy traversal
- `xiduzo/gh-issue-dependency` — dependency ordering

If any are missing, install them before proceeding.

### 1. Identify the target and build the dependency graph

Call `AskUserQuestion` (per `../references/questioning-style.md`):
- question: "What do you want to execute?"
- header: "Target"
- options:
  - One option per open Feature (e.g. **Feature #<n> — <title>** → execute all Tasks under this Feature)
  - One **Epic — all features** option if an Epic is available
  - **Resume a previous run** → fetch open tasks not yet labeled `implemented` or `verified`; skip to step 4 from the first unfinished task

**Fetch the hierarchy:**

If a Feature is selected:

```bash
gh issue view <feature_number>
gh sub-issue list <feature_number>
```

If an Epic is selected:

```bash
gh issue view <epic_number>
gh sub-issue list <epic_number>        # yields feature numbers
# For each feature in parallel:
gh sub-issue list <feature_number>     # yields task numbers
```

Build the full node list with parent context: `(issue_number, type, parent_chain)`. **Include every issue in the run regardless of type** — Tasks, Features, Epics, Bugs, and any loose/untyped issues linked in via sub-issue or dependency edges. Type does not gate inclusion; any issue that can block, be blocked by, or share files with another issue in the run belongs in the graph.

Walk the full transitive closure: start from the selected target, follow `gh sub-issue list` down, follow `gh issue-dependency list` outward (both directions), and keep pulling until no new issues surface. Do not stop at Feature or Epic boundaries — a Bug linked as a blocker of a Task belongs in the DAG just like the Task does.

**Build the dependency graph:**

For every node in the list — type-agnostic — fetch its dependency edges in parallel:

```bash
gh issue-dependency list <issue_number>
```

This returns two sets per issue: what it **blocks** and what **blocks it**. Record both directions for every node. Build a directed graph:

```
nodes:  { issue_number → { title, type, feature, labels } }
edges:  { issue_number → blocks: [issue_numbers], blocked_by: [issue_numbers] }
```

**Classify each dependency as internal or external:**

- **Internal** — the blocking issue is within the current run's node list. Execution order must respect this edge.
- **External** — the blocking issue is outside the current run (different feature, already-merged task, upstream work). This issue must already be merged before the loop can start.

Record this classification in the graph — it drives both the execution order (step 3) and the external blocker gate (step 2d).

### 2. Pre-flight validation

Run all four checks (a. spec completeness, b. contradiction scan, c. codebase reality, d. dependency validation) per `references/pre-flight-validation.md`. Run in parallel where possible. Surface findings via the Pre-flight gate from the same reference — do not silently skip.

The dependency-validation step (d) produces the `phases → sub_phases → tasks` structure used in step 3 and step 4.

### 3. Propose the execution plan and wait for approval

Present the dependency-ordered plan as a suggestion derived from the graph. Do not start any implementation until the human explicitly approves it.

Tasks within a phase have no internal dependencies between them; tasks in a later phase depend on at least one task from an earlier phase.

```
Proposed execution plan — Feature #<n>: <title>
─────────────────────────────────────────────
External blockers: ✅ #<x> merged  ✅ #<y> merged

Phase 1  (no blockers)
  Sub-phase 1.1  [parallel]
    Task #10 — Setup DB schema        impacted: src/db/
    Task #11 — Define API contracts   impacted: src/api/contracts/
  Sub-phase 1.2  [after 1.1 — file conflict with #10]
    Task #14 — Seed migrations        impacted: src/db/

Phase 2  (blocked by Phase 1)
  Sub-phase 2.1  [parallel]
    Task #12 — Settlement logic       blocked by #10, #11  ·  blocks #13

Phase 3  (blocked by Phase 2)
  Sub-phase 3.1  [parallel]
    Task #13 — Notifications          blocked by #12
─────────────────────────────────────────────
3 phases · 5 tasks · 4 sub-phases
```

If executing an Epic, also show cross-feature blocking:

```
Feature #5 — Payment Settlement   (no feature-level blockers)
Feature #6 — Reporting            blocked by Feature #5
```

Call `AskUserQuestion` (per `../references/questioning-style.md`):
- question: "Here's the suggested execution plan based on the dependency graph. Does this look right?"
- header: "Plan review"
- options:
  - **Approve — start the loop** → execute tasks in this order
  - **Remove a task** → drop one or more tasks from this run; specify which
  - **Change the order** → override the suggested phase ordering; describe the change
  - **Decline — stop** → exit without executing anything

**If "Remove a task":** ask which tasks to drop, remove them from the graph (and re-evaluate whether any remaining tasks lose all their blockers and can move to an earlier phase), then re-present the updated plan and ask again.

**If "Change the order":** ask the user to describe the desired change. Apply it, check that no `blocked_by` edges are violated by the new order (warn if they are but do not block), re-present the updated plan and ask again.

**If "Decline — stop":** exit immediately. Nothing has been implemented.

**Only proceed to step 4 after an explicit "Approve" answer.**

### 4. Execute each task

Run the per-task sequence (a. dependency gate, b. implement, c. verify, d. open PR + pipeline, e. progress update) per `references/task-execution.md`. The reference also covers the parallelism-via-DAG-sub-phases rules and the inline step ranges to paste into each sub-agent prompt (`wtf.implement-task` 4–11, `wtf.verify-task` 2–7, `wtf.create-pr` 4–8).

Apply `../references/subagent-protocol.md` for every Agent call. The conflict-free sub-phases from step 2d drive parallelism — within a sub-phase tasks run in parallel via Agent `isolation: "worktree"`; between sub-phases all PRs must merge before advancing.

### 5. Feature PR (after all tasks)

Once all Tasks' PRs are merged into the feature branch, open a PR from the feature branch to `main`. Use both signals together — a task is complete only when its PR is merged AND the issue is closed:

```bash
gh pr list --state merged --base feature/<feature-number>-<feature-slug>
gh sub-issue list <feature_number>
# Should be empty (all task issues closed via merged PRs)
```

If both checks show all work is complete (no open sub-issues, all task PRs merged), open the feature PR automatically — no confirmation needed.

If either check shows pending work, list the outstanding tasks and call `AskUserQuestion` (per `../references/questioning-style.md`):
- question: "Not all task PRs are merged yet. Open the feature PR anyway?"
- header: "Feature PR"
- options:
  - **Wait — I'll merge them first** → pause here
  - **Open it now** → open feature → main PR with unmerged tasks noted in description

Open the feature PR by spawning a sub-agent running the inlined `wtf.create-pr` steps targeting `main`. The body must include `Closes #<feature_number>` and one `Closes #<task_number>` per task on separate lines per `../references/commit-conventions.md`.

After opening, poll and merge using the same pipeline pattern as step 4d — wait for all checks, auto-merge on green, gate on red.

### 6. Summary

Print a final summary:

```
Loop complete — Feature #<n>: <title>
─────────────────────────────────────
Tasks completed:  [n]
Tasks skipped:    [n]
PRs merged:       [list of URLs]
Feature PR:       <url> (merged / open — pipeline pending)
```

If any Tasks were skipped, list them with reasons and suggest follow-up actions.

### Human-in-the-loop gate reference

The loop pauses and asks for human input only when:

| Trigger | Why human input is needed |
|---|---|
| Spec contradiction (Task vs Feature) | Model cannot resolve intent ambiguity |
| Spec contradiction (Feature vs Epic) | Scope boundary unclear |
| Codebase mismatch (contract/module missing) | Implementation target may have changed |
| Missing Gherkin or Contracts | Cannot implement without a test target |
| Circular dependency (internal) | Hard stop — cannot resolve automatically |
| External blocker not yet merged/closed | Loop cannot start until upstream work is done |
| Internal blocker skipped or unmerged mid-run | Ordering constraint within the current run |
| Gherkin scenario not covered by test suite | No automated signal — human must verify manually |
| Covered test(s) fail | Implementation may need rework |
| PR pipeline check(s) fail | CI signal is authoritative — human must decide whether to fix or skip |
| Pending task PRs before feature PR | Some tasks not yet merged — human decides whether to wait or open early |
