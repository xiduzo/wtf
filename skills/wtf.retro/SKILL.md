description: This skill should be used when a team wants to close out a completed Epic or sprint, capture what was planned vs. what shipped, learn from deviations, and formally mark the Epic done — for example "run a retro on this epic", "close out the epic", "what deviated from the plan", "retrospective for epic #X", "what did we learn from this epic", "mark this epic as complete", or "write up the post-mortem". Routes learnings into steering docs and generates a final Epic summary. Pairs naturally with the changelog skill for the user-facing output.

# Retro

Close out a completed Epic with a structured retrospective. Core value: compares what was planned (original Epic spec) against what shipped (closed Tasks + PRs), surfaces deviations, routes learnings into steering docs, and formally closes the Epic so the team starts the next initiative with a clean slate.

## Process

### 0. GitHub CLI setup

Run steps 1–2 of `../references/gh-setup.md`. Stop if `gh` is not installed or not authenticated.

### 1. Identify the Epic

If an Epic number was passed in, use it directly. Otherwise call `AskUserQuestion` (per `../references/questioning-style.md`):
- question: "Which Epic are you closing out?"
- header: "Epic"
- options: from open Epics via `gh issue list --label epic --state open --limit 10`

Fetch the Epic and its full hierarchy:

```bash
gh issue view <epic_number>
gh sub-issue list <epic_number>              # feature numbers
# For each feature (in parallel):
gh issue view <feature_number>
gh sub-issue list <feature_number>           # task numbers
# For each task (in parallel):
gh issue view <task_number>
```

Also fetch:
- All PRs that closed issues under this Epic (search by `Closes #<n>` in merged PRs):
  ```bash
  gh pr list --state merged --json number,title,body,mergedAt --limit 100
  ```
- The original Epic creation date and the date of the last merged PR (actual duration)

### 2. Check completion status

Verify all work is actually done before running a retro:

- All child Features are closed
- All child Tasks are closed (or explicitly marked `won't implement`)
- No open PRs targeting feature branches under this Epic

If anything is still open, call `AskUserQuestion` (per `../references/questioning-style.md`):
- question: "Not all work is closed yet — [list open items]. Run the retro anyway?"
- header: "Incomplete work"
- options:
  - **Run retro anyway** → some items are open; note them as incomplete
  - **Wait until complete** → exit; finish the remaining work first

### 3. Compare planned vs. shipped

Build a side-by-side comparison:

**Planned** (from original Epic spec):
- Goal statement
- Success Metrics
- Feature Breakdown (original list from Epic body)
- Bounded Context

**Shipped** (from closed issues and PRs):
- Features actually created and merged
- Tasks actually created and merged
- Actual calendar duration (Epic opened → last PR merged)

Identify deviations:
- Features planned but not built (descoped or deferred)
- Features added that were not in the original breakdown (scope growth)
- Tasks that took significantly more iterations than expected (PR re-open, multiple verify cycles)
- Success Metrics: were they actually achieved? (state what you can verify from the spec; flag ones that require manual measurement)

### 4. Gather learnings

Only ask what isn't already evident from the issue history. For each question below, call `AskUserQuestion` (per `../references/questioning-style.md`).

**Q1 — What was harder than expected?**

Call `AskUserQuestion` (per `../references/questioning-style.md`):
- question: "What was harder or took longer than planned in this Epic?"
- header: "Friction points"
- options: 2–3 inferences from the deviation analysis (e.g. "Feature #X needed 3 verify cycles", "Task #Y was unscoped after implementation started")

**Q2 — What should we do differently next time?**

Call `AskUserQuestion` (per `../references/questioning-style.md`):
- question: "If you ran this Epic again, what would you change about how it was planned or executed?"
- header: "Process improvements"
- options:
  - **Better scoping upfront** → scope drift was the main issue
  - **Earlier design** → design gaps caused implementation rework
  - **Clearer contracts** → interface ambiguity caused re-work
  - **Nothing significant** → execution was smooth

**Q3 — Any domain model insights?**

Call `AskUserQuestion` (per `../references/questioning-style.md`):
- question: "Did this Epic reveal anything new about the domain model — new concepts, corrected names, missing bounded contexts?"
- header: "Domain insights"
- options:
  - **Yes — describe them** → new terms or corrections to capture
  - **No domain changes** → model held up well

### 5. Route learnings to steering docs

For each learning gathered, determine where it belongs using the same routing table as `wtf.reflect`:

| Learning type | Target doc |
|---|---|
| Architecture pattern, implementation gotcha | `TECH.md` |
| Test failure pattern, QA gap | `QA.md` |
| Design inconsistency, component misuse | `DESIGN.md` |
| Scope confusion, domain language drift | `VISION.md` |
| Doesn't clearly fit | `TECH.md` (default) |

For each target doc, append under `## Hard-Won Lessons` using the format:

```
- **[Short label]** — [Concrete rule or observation]. *Learned <YYYY-MM-DD> during Epic #<n>.*
```

Commit the steering doc updates:

```bash
git add docs/steering/
git commit -m "docs(steering): lessons from Epic #<epic_number>"
```

If any domain model insights were gathered (Q3), also update the glossary via the same pattern as `wtf.write-epic` step 10.

### 6. Write the retro summary

Post a structured retro comment on the Epic issue:

```bash
gh issue comment <epic_number> --body "<retro_summary>"
```

The retro summary must include:

```markdown
## Retrospective — <YYYY-MM-DD>

**Duration:** <Epic opened> → <last PR merged> ([n] days)

### Planned vs. shipped

| Item | Planned | Shipped | Delta |
|------|---------|---------|-------|
| Features | [n] | [n] | [+n added / -n descoped] |
| Tasks | [n] | [n] | ... |

**Descoped:** [list features/tasks that were planned but not built — with reason]  
**Added:** [list features/tasks added beyond original scope — with reason]

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|--------|--------|----------|
| <from Epic spec> | <value> | ✅ / ❌ / ⚠️ needs manual check |

### Lessons learned

[Bullet list of the learnings gathered in step 4 — in plain language, not the steering doc format]

### Steering docs updated

[List which docs were updated with new lessons]
```

### 7. Offer to generate a changelog

Call `AskUserQuestion` (per `../references/questioning-style.md`):
- question: "Would you like to generate a changelog entry or GitHub Release for this Epic?"
- header: "Changelog"
- options:
  - **Yes — run changelog** → run `wtf.changelog` for this Epic (recommended)
  - **Not now** → skip; I'll handle the release notes separately

If yes → follow the `wtf.changelog` process with the Epic number pre-loaded as context.

### 8. Close the Epic

The Epic closes automatically when all child Feature PRs contain `Closes #<feature_number>`, which in turn contains `Closes #<epic_number>` — via GitHub's auto-close chain. Confirm this has happened:

```bash
gh issue view <epic_number> --json state -q .state
```

If the Epic is already `CLOSED` → print: "Epic #<n> is already closed via merged PRs. Retro complete."

If still open (e.g. auto-close chain didn't fire): ask the user whether to close it via a merged PR reference or directly:

Call `AskUserQuestion` (per `../references/questioning-style.md`):
- question: "Epic #<n> is still open. How would you like to close it?"
- header: "Close Epic"
- options:
  - **Close as completed** → mark as closed; all work is done
  - **Leave open** → I'll close it separately

If "Close as completed":
```bash
gh issue close <epic_number> --comment "Closed after retro — all Features and Tasks merged."
```

### 9. Print the final summary

```
Retro complete — Epic #<n>: <title>
──────────────────────────────────────
Duration:      [n] days
Features:      [n] shipped / [n] descoped
Tasks:         [n] merged
Learnings:     [n] captured → TECH.md, QA.md, ...
Epic status:   closed ✅
```
